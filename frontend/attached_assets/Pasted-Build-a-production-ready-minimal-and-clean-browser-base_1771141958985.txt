Build a production-ready, minimal and clean browser-based dashboard for a real-time Gesture-Controlled Drone System.

Tech Stack:

Frontend: React (Vite)

Backend: Node.js + Express

Real-time Communication: WebSockets (Socket.io)

Authentication: JWT-based login system

Architecture: Ready for cloud deployment (modular structure)

Separate service endpoint for triggering Python ML retraining

🎯 Project Overview

This dashboard is the primary interface for:

Real-time gesture monitoring

Drone action mapping visualization

Gesture-to-action configuration

Model retraining triggers

System health monitoring

Secure login-based access

The UI must be minimal, clean, modern, and responsive.

🔐 Authentication Requirements

Implement:

Login page

Protected routes

JWT token storage

Logout functionality

Password hashing (bcrypt)

Design:

Centered login card

Clean form

Subtle shadows

Light theme

📡 Real-Time System Feedback (WebSocket)

Implement live panel showing:

Current detected gesture

Confidence score

Mapped drone action

Drone status (Idle / Executing / Error)

WebSocket connection status (Connected / Disconnected)

This panel must update instantly without page refresh.

Use animated status indicators (green/yellow/red dots).

✋ Gesture Configuration Panel

Create a section where:

All detected gestures are listed

Each gesture has a dropdown to select drone action

Changes update backend via API

Current mappings are clearly visible

Example:

Gesture | Mapped Action
UP | Increase Altitude
LEFT | Rotate Left

🧠 Model Retraining Panel

Include:

"Trigger Retraining" button

Confirmation modal before triggering

API call to backend endpoint /retrain

Display:

Training status (Idle / Running / Completed / Failed)

Progress indicator (if simulated)

Last retrained timestamp

Design must clearly differentiate retraining state.

📊 System Status Section

Show:

Backend status

ML service status

WebSocket status

Last gesture received time

Total predictions count

Use clean info cards layout.

🎨 UI/UX Requirements

Minimal + clean design

Use TailwindCSS

Soft shadows

Rounded corners

Smooth transitions

Fully responsive

Dashboard layout with sidebar navigation

Sidebar Sections:

Dashboard

Gesture Mapping

Retraining

System Status

Logout

🧩 Backend Requirements

Implement:

REST API for:

Login

Fetch gesture mappings

Update mapping

Trigger retraining

System health check

WebSocket server that:

Emits gesture updates

Emits drone status

Emits training status

Simulate gesture stream if real ML not connected.

🚀 Cloud Deployment Ready

Environment variable support

Modular service structure

CORS handling

Production build script

💎 Extra Professional Touch

Add:

Toast notifications

Loading states

Error boundaries

Clean code comments

Organized reusable components

Create full working boilerplate with proper code separation and modern best practices.
